                <!-- Extending Your Reservation -->
                <h3 id="extend-reservation">Extending Your Reservation</h3>
                <p>
                    If you require additional time with the vehicle, you are welcome to extend your reservation. Should the current vehicle be unavailable for an extension, we encourage you to explore other options within our fleet, subject to availability.
                </p>

                    If you choose not to extend your reservation, please ensure that you return the vehicle to the designated pickup location by the reserved ending time. For those who do not have the prepaid charging option, it is essential to return the vehicle with at least a 70% charge.
