                    Charge Key is a digital car key that provides you with access to your rental vehicle through a simple link. This technology streamlines the rental process, allowing you to charge your vehicle at a Supercharger with payments automatically processed using your saved payment method. There is no need to pay at the charger or request reimbursements later.

                <p>
                    When you use a Supercharger, the charging cost is automatically billed to your payment method on file. This means you do not need to manually pay at the charger, simplifying the process for you.
